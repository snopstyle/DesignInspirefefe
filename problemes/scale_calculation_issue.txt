Problem: Quiz Score Calculation Issue
Date: January 2024

Issue Description:
The quiz score calculation was incorrect due to a mismatch between the answer scale and question format. The answerValue function was using a default 10-point scale when most questions actually use a 5-point scale, resulting in scores of 0 for valid answers.

Symptoms:
- All trait scores were calculating as 0
- Console logs showed "value 0" for valid answers
- Profile matching was inaccurate due to zero scores

Fix Applied:
1. Updated the answerValue function in profile-logic.ts to use correct 5-point scale
2. Added proper answer value mappings for each question type
3. Ensured question IDs are properly formatted with "Q" prefix when looking up scales

Code Changes:
- Modified the default scale in answerValue function
- Added specific scale mappings for each question format
- Fixed question ID formatting in calculateProfileScores

Impact:
- Correct score calculation for all answer types
- Accurate trait scoring
- Proper profile matching based on actual user responses

Future Prevention:
- Add input validation for answer scales
- Implement unit tests for score calculation
- Add logging for scale mismatches
