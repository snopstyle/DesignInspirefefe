Issue: Temporary User Creation Failure
Date: January 24, 2025

Problem Description:
The application was failing to create temporary users with the error message "Failed to create temporary user" and 
"error: column 'username' of relation 'temp_users' does not exist".

Symptoms:
1. Server logs showing 500 error responses on POST /api/users/temp
2. Error message indicating missing 'username' column
3. Session initialization failures
4. Frontend unable to proceed with user flow

Root Cause:
The issue stemmed from a mismatch between the database schema and the application code:
1. The code was trying to insert a username field that didn't exist in the database
2. The temp_users table schema was not properly synchronized between Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL
3. Time zone handling for the created_at field was inconsistent

Solution:
1. Simplified the temp_users table schema to only essential fields:
   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - created_at (timestamptz, not null, default now)

2. Created the table directly via SQL first to ensure correct structure
3. Updated the Drizzle schema to match exactly:
   - Added proper timezone handling for created_at
   - Removed unnecessary fields like username
   - Ensured UUID generation used database's gen_random_uuid()

4. Synchronized the schema between code and database using drizzle-kit

Impact Resolution:
- Temporary user creation now works correctly
- Session management functions properly
- Frontend flow proceeds without interruption

Lessons Learned:
1. Always ensure database schema matches exactly between ORM and actual database
2. Use timestamptz for timestamp fields to avoid timezone issues
3. Start with minimal schema and add fields as needed
4. Verify table structure directly in database before implementing ORM changes
