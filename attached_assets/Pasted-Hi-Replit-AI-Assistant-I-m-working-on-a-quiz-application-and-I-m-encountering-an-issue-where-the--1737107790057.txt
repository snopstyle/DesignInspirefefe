Hi Replit AI Assistant,

I'm working on a quiz application, and I'm encountering an issue where the quiz results fail to save at the end of the quiz. The error message I receive is: failed to save quiz results.

Here’s some context about my project:

File Structure:

quiz-logic.ts: Contains the logic for handling quiz results and saving them.

queryClient.ts: Configures the React Query client for managing API requests.

utils.ts: Contains utility functions (e.g., for merging class names).

Current Implementation:

The queryClient.ts file sets up a QueryClient with default options for queries and mutations.

The quiz-logic.ts file is supposed to handle saving quiz results, but it seems the mutation for saving results is not working as expected.

Error Details:

When the quiz ends, the app attempts to save the results by making a POST request to /api/save-results.

The request fails, and the error failed to save quiz results is logged.

What I Need Help With:

Debugging why the quiz results are not being saved.

Ensuring the mutation for saving quiz results is correctly implemented.

Checking if the API endpoint (/api/save-results) is properly configured and accessible.

Here are the relevant code snippets:

queryClient.ts:

typescript
Copy
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      queryFn: async ({ queryKey }) => {
        const res = await fetch(queryKey[0] as string, {
          credentials: "include",
        });

        if (!res.ok) {
          if (res.status >= 500) {
            throw new Error(`${res.status}: ${res.statusText}`);
          }

          throw new Error(`${res.status}: ${await res.text()}`);
        }

        return res.json();
      },
      refetchInterval: false,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      staleTime: Infinity,
      retry: false,
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: false,
    }
  },
});
quiz-logic.ts:

typescript
Copy
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const useSaveQuizResults = () => {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (results: any) => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/save-results', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        credentials: 'include',
        body: JSON.stringify(results),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to save quiz results: ${response.statusText}`);
      }

      return response.json();
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('Error saving quiz results:', error);
    },
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      console.log('Quiz results saved successfully:', data);
    },
  });
};
Questions:

Is the useSaveQuizResults mutation correctly implemented?

Are there any issues with the queryClient.ts configuration that could prevent the mutation from working?

How can I debug the API request to /api/save-results to ensure it’s functioning correctly?

Are there any additional steps I need to take to ensure the quiz results are saved successfully?

Thank you for your help!
