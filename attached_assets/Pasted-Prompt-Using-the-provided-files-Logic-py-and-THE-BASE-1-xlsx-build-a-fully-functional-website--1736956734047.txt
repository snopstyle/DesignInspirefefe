Prompt:

"Using the provided files Logic.py and THE BASE (1).xlsx, build a fully functional website that implements a Profile Matching System. The website should allow users to take a quiz based on the adaptive tree structure defined in Logic.py and the question weights, key traits, and sub-profiles defined in THE BASE (1).xlsx.

The website should include the following features:

User Interface (UI):

A clean, user-friendly interface where users can start the quiz.

Display questions one at a time, based on the adaptive tree structure.

Allow users to select answers from predefined options (e.g., dropdowns, radio buttons, or sliders).

Show progress (e.g., "Question 1 of 25").

Quiz Logic:

Implement the adaptive tree logic from Logic.py to determine the next question based on the user's previous answer.

Use the question weights and key traits from THE BASE (1).xlsx to calculate the user's scores for each key trait.

Map the user's answers to sub-profiles and dominant profiles based on the weights and traits defined in the Excel file.

Profile Matching:

After the quiz, calculate the user's dominant profile and sub-profile based on their answers.

Display the results to the user, including:

Their dominant profile (e.g., "The Analytical Thinker").

Their sub-profile (e.g., "The Researcher").

A summary of their key traits and strengths.

Career paths and academic recommendations based on their profile.

Data Storage:

Store user answers and results in a database (e.g., SQLite or Firebase) for future reference.

Allow users to revisit their results by logging in or providing a unique identifier.

Additional Features:

Include a section where users can explore detailed information about each profile (e.g., summaries, career paths, academic backing, and celebrity examples from the "Summary" sheet in THE BASE (1).xlsx).

Add a feedback form for users to provide input on their experience.

Implement a responsive design to ensure the website works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technical Requirements:

Use Python (Flask or Django) for the backend to handle quiz logic and profile matching.

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like React) for the frontend.

Use the data from THE BASE (1).xlsx to populate the quiz questions, weights, and profile information.

Ensure the website is fully functional, with no bugs or errors in the quiz logic or profile matching.
